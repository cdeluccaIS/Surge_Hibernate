Hibernate Breakdown:
       
       - hibernate.cfg.xml - file which handles connection to the DB
       
       - <table_name>.hbm.xml - file which maps the target table to a Java  Object
       
       - <Method>.java - Java bean which contains the setters and getters for the table
       
       - <Program_name>.java - Java program which ties this all together and accomplishes additional logic
